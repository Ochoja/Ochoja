Hi, I’m Daniel Ochoja, a software engineer with a passion for building scalable web applications and creating seamless user experiences. I specialize in full-stack development, leveraging technologies like React.js, Vue.js, and Python for backend development to create dynamic, user-centered solutions.

I enjoy working across the entire software development lifecycle, from designing and implementing front-end interfaces to building robust backend systems. With a strong foundation in frontend technologies (React.js, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend frameworks like Flask and Node.js, I focus on creating performant and maintainable code that delivers results.
